# hello-world
This is my first encounter here on github where I am now being taught how to surf this better and get the best out of it. It's already exciting and trust me I'm pretty much having fun.
As a young African with the passion to explore new technologies I believe to transform my continent and the world using this same passion. I have decided to get myself soly committed as a percieve very hard enough to achieve this dream.
